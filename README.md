# AutoCompleteSearchAnalysisCode
Implemented a time and space efficient algorithm for auto complete search using C++ for implementation.<br/>
Compared various data structures and algorithms such as naive approach(using binary search) and the approach using segment tree and max heap,in terms of time and space complexity.


## How to start
1.compile and Run the NaiveApproach.cpp ,TastierApproach.cpp files in your favourite platform like codeblocks or online IDE.<br/>
2.It will then display list of all the phrases in the dictionary and their respective weights on to the console.<br/>
3.Enter the query prefix.<br/>
3.Top 3 suggestions are printed out in console.

 The words in the dictionary are shown at the top with their respective weights. The user entered a prefix and as the number of outcomes we gave are 3,the top three suggestions are out.
